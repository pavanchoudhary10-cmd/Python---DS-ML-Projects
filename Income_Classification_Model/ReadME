recently completed an exciting ML project where I built an Income Classification Model to predict whether an individual earns more than $50,000/year using demographic and socio-economic data.

What started as a simple classification problem quickly turned into a deep exploration of how education, experience, work hours, and personal circumstances influence earning potential in the real world.

🔍 Key Insights from the Data

Here’s what the data revealed:

🔹 Education is the strongest predictor of high income.
🔹 Individuals between 30–55 years dominate the >50K bracket.
🔹 Capital gains (investments) play a major role in higher earnings.
🔹 Working 40+ hours/week significantly increases income likelihood.
🔹 Married individuals are far more represented in the high-income group.
🔹 A visible gender gap still persists in income distribution.

These patterns reflect real socio-economic trends that influence earning power beyond just job roles.

🤖 Model Building & Optimization

I developed and compared two models:

1️⃣ Random Forest (Baseline)
✔️ Accuracy: 86%
❌ Recall for >50K: 0.64

2️⃣ XGBoost + SMOTE (Tuned for Recall)
✔️ Recall for >50K: 0.93
✔️ Best at identifying high-income individuals
⚠️ Slight dip in accuracy (78%), but worth it for real-world use cases

Why focus on recall?
👉 In scenarios like HR analytics, financial targeting, or policy planning, missing a true high-income individual is more costly than a few false positives.

🌟 Feature Importance

Top factors influencing income:

1️⃣ Education Level
2️⃣ Capital Gains
3️⃣ Age
4️⃣ Hours Worked per Week
5️⃣ Marital Status
6️⃣ Occupation
7️⃣ Gender
8️⃣ Country

Understanding these variables helps drive data-informed decisions in workforce strategy, policy design, and economic analysis.

🎯 Final Reflection

This project reinforced how machine learning can uncover hidden socio-economic patterns and support more equitable, informed decision-making in society.
