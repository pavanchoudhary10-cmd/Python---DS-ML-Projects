🚀 New ML Project Alert!

I recently built a House Price Prediction Model using Python and Machine Learning — designed to estimate property prices based on key physical features like Building Area, Land Area, Bedrooms, Bathrooms, and Garage capacity.

🔧 Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy for data preprocessing
Seaborn, Matplotlib for Exploratory Data Analysis
Scikit-learn for ML model building (Random Forest Regressor)
📊 Workflow Highlights

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation — Renamed columns, handled missing values, and extracted meaningful features.
2️⃣ EDA — Explored feature relationships using pair plots and correlation heatmaps.
3️⃣ Model Training — Split dataset (80/20) and trained a RandomForestRegressor (n_estimators=200) for robust predictions.
4️⃣ Evaluation — Measured performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² Score.
5️⃣ Visualization — Compared actual vs predicted prices with scatter plots.
6️⃣ Prediction — Generated price predictions for new houses with customizable input features.

🧠 Key Takeaway

Random Forest performed efficiently in predicting house prices by learning complex relationships between property attributes and market value.
