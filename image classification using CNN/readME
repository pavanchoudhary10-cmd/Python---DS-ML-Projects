Excited to share my latest hands-on project in Computer Vision, where I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images effectively using TensorFlow & Keras!

ðŸ”¹ Project Highlights:

Preprocessed and reshaped image data (100Ã—100 RGB images)

Encoded categorical labels using LabelEncoder and to_categorical()

Built a custom CNN architecture with:

Conv2D + MaxPooling2D layers for feature extraction

Flatten + Dense layers for classification

Dropout for regularization and preventing overfitting

Implemented data augmentation with ImageDataGenerator to enhance generalization

Trained the model with 100 epochs, tuning batch size and validation strategy

ðŸ“Š Model Performance:

Achieved strong accuracy and balance across classes (as shown in the classification report)

Visualized model accuracy and loss trends for both training & validation

Integrated continuous augmentation-based learning for improved robustness

ðŸ§  Tech Stack:
Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn

ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings:

Importance of proper data reshaping and encoding in CNNs

How augmentation boosts CNN generalization

Balancing model complexity and overfitting using Dropout layers
