Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection

In a world where millions of transactions happen every minute, detecting fraudulent activity is crucial. So, I took on a project to tackle this challenge using Machine Learning — and the results were truly eye-opening! 💳✨

🔍 Here’s what I did:

 ✅ Performed extensive EDA to uncover hidden patterns and outliers. 

✅ Cleaned and preprocessed 28 anonymized transaction features (V1–V28) + Amount + Class. 

✅ Balanced the highly skewed dataset using SMOTE to address class imbalance. 

✅ Built a LightGBM model for fast and accurate fraud prediction. 

✅ Evaluated with metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC for a fair assessment.



📈 Highlights:

Achieved strong detection capability on minority (fraud) class 💥

Visualized key feature importance and distribution insights

Learned how data imbalance can mislead even good models



🧠 Tech Stack: Python | Pandas | NumPy | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Scikit-learn | LightGBM | SMOTE



Fraud detection isn’t just about accuracy — it’s about trust, responsibility, and impact. Every true positive here represents a real-world fraud prevented.
