Objective of the Project

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars based on their key features such as car brand/model, year of manufacture, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and ownership history.

ðŸ”‘ Sub-objectives

Data Understanding & Cleaning

Perform EDA to analyze patterns and detect missing values, outliers, and correlations.

Handle missing data, inconsistent categories, and outliers in numerical features.

Feature Engineering

Extract useful features such as car brand from name.

Create car age (current_year - year).

Convert categorical variables (fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner) into numerical form.

Model Development

Train regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost).

Compare performance using MSE and RÂ² score.

Prevent overfitting by validating with cross-validation.

Insights for Stakeholders

Identify key factors affecting car prices (e.g., car age, kilometers driven, fuel type).

Provide a tool that helps buyers and sellers estimate fair car prices.

âœ… Final Deliverable

A robust ML-based predictive system that:

Accurately estimates used car prices.

Provides insights into important price-driving features.

Can be integrated into a car resale platform, dealership system, or used as a standalone decision-support tool.
